/*
 * We use one shader for all shading types.
 * Terrain (1): RGBAs + DiffuseColor
 * Shrubs (2): StaticColor + DiffuseColor
 * Ties (3): Colorbytes + DiffuseColor
 * Mobies (4): StaticColor + DiffuseColor
 *
 * Some Notes about the rendering in the game:
 * - Ratchets helmet treats light in the opposite direction, i.e.
 *   if a directional light points up, it will be treated as if it was pointing down.
 * - Ratchets helmet and the ship seem to be the only objects that
 *   have specular highlights.
 * - Fog seems to be twice as bright for ties.
 * - Terrain does not use alpha cutoff.
 * - In RaC 3, ties do not use alpha cutoff. Replanetizer uses the RaC 1 and 2 behaviour.
